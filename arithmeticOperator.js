// **************** Arithmetic operator *******************


// * play with this 

let num1 = 3;
let num2 = 5;
let num3 = 6
let result1 = num1 + num2 + num3;
// * Q. how do i print the answer?
// * Q. what is the other use case of that we had discuss


 num1 = 3;
 num2 = 5;
let num3 = 6
// * You see the num3 is showing a red underline what could be the reason and how do you solve the problem?
let result2 = num1 + num2 - num3;
print result2

// * try it for multiplication and division 

let n1 = 5;
 let n2 = 6;
 let n3 = 8;
 let n4 = 10;
 let ans = n4 - (n2 * n1) + n3
 console.log(ans)

//  * wait a minute what the hell is happening here???
// * and if u want to alter how this is working how do you do it??


// **************************** MODULUS *******************************

// **  A modulus also known as a remainder is the value you get when you divide two numbers

let a = 8; 
let b = 3;
let r1  = 8 % 3;
// * run this code and let see the answer
