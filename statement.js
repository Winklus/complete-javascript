Statements
let x, y, z;    // Statement 1
x = 5;          // Statement 2
y = 6;          // Statement 3
z = x + y;      // Statement 4


JavaScript Programs
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.


JavaScript Statements
JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";

Semicolons ;
Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:


let a, b, c;  // Declare 3 variables
a = 5;        // Assign the value 5 to a
b = 6;        // Assign the value 6 to b
c = a + b;    // Assign the sum of a and b to c


JavaScript White Space
JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

The following lines are equivalent:
let person = "Hege";
let person="Hege"; 
// * y we use choose the first one because it is more readable

A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):
let x = y + z;

JavaScript Code Blocks
JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:
